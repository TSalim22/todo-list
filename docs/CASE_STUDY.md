# To-Do List: project notes

## Goal

Keep personal tasks organised.

## Main challenge

Protect records across different accounts.

## Implementation choice

Ownership checks on every edit, toggle and delete. The repository is intentionally small, with its main application code and tests kept close together.

## Outcome and validation

The local workflow is implemented, with automated checks covering its core behaviour. See the README for limits and any service-dependent features. External API tests use simulated clients rather than paid or private live data. This is an implementation case study, not a claim of commercial use or earlier completion.

## Next improvements

Improve the interface based on real usage and extend tests when adding new behaviour. Keep changes incremental so the project remains easy to explain.
